# Colorful (Simplified) for EmulationStation: <br>System Video Addon (720p Version)

This is a system video addon for the [Colorful (Simplified)](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/colorful-simplified-es) theme.  The videos were created by [viking](https://forums.launchbox-app.com/profile/70421-viking/) and others from the launchbox community.  All credit to them and huge thanks for their work.  This repository simply organizes a subset of the colorful video set to be easily used with the port of the theme that I made for EmulationStation.

## Changes Made:
- renamed videos to match the naming conventions used in Batocera, RetroBat and JELOS
- resized videos to 720p for use on lower end hardware
- created an XML file to enable integration into EmulationStation through its native `Theme Configuration` menu.

## How to Use:

### 1) Start Here
- Please make sure you have the [Colorful (Simplified)](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/colorful-simplified-es) installed and running.
- Make sure the `Distribution` setting is set to the correct value for your current OS (e.g. Batocera, JELOS or RetroBat)
- You can find this setting in `User Interface Settings > Theme Configuration` in EmulationStation's Main Menu
- This value determines the folder where you will add the files from this addon
    - Batocera = `/userdata/theme-customizations/colorful-simplified/`
    - Retrobat = `C:\RetroBat\emulationstation\.emulationstation\theme-customizations\colorful-simplified\`
    - JELOS = `/storage/roms/theme-customizations/colorful-simplified/`
- Make sure to create the folders from above that match your distribution and then move on to the next step...

### 2) Download the latest release 
- Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/colorful-simplified-es-addons-video-720/releases/latest)
- Extract it into the folder you created from the previous step (the `system-view-video.xml` file and the `videos` folder should be the top level things you see after extractng it to your directory)

### 3) Open the Theme Configuration in EmulationStation
- In EmulationStation open the Main Menu and navigate to `User Interface Settings > Theme Configuration`
- You should see a new option displayed called `System View Video` - Set that to `On` to display videos and `Off` to hide them.
